### Helm templates

These are helm templates that I use on my own server.

### Tenets
* Designed for small scale - I use these templates on my own dedicated server so these templates focus on smaller scale deployments, while still following the Kubernetes paradigms
* Simple - I try to avoid too many parameters and provide sane defaults
